* Introduction
This =orgmode= file contains the explaination of the Web Pages and their layout along with their attached codes.

In order to create the FrontEnd of this Application, Bootstrap was extensively used and no premade templates were directly taken.

* Web Pages
** Main Page (Home)
*** Design
The =home= of the application, starts the page with the =navigation bar= along with the =search bar= and several links attached.
Along with this there are the =Log in= and =Register= buttons as well. 

Below the main =nav bar=, we have a =carousel= with a scroll of data. Temporarily I have set the limit on scroll to be 3, however 
this can be changed to suit site functionality.

Followed the over =carousel=, we have several tables of data, that are populated based on the criteria of the table (most popular,
grossing, etc.). Below this we some links that give the website a more realistic feel such as the =privacy= and =terms= links 
along with an added functionality of a link to go back to the top on click.
